Each folder has its own problem contained within it. In 62 and 240 we have our 
failed MPI versions and the 'smart' approaches. 377 is properly implemented on 
MPI. Each folder also contains it's own readme for the problem. 

Our github is available at https://github.com/cptwalmart/Project1/ and will be 
private after graded for bonus credit.
